## TODO
- use more str, fewer char *
- fix unary `!a` eval
- eval_file
    - separate fsize and read_file?
    - grow buffer to match file size
    - or change read_file to alloc and return byte array?
- parsing: synchronize
- str
    - change to `span`?
    - `string` and `str`
        - one is mutable stretchy buffer for strings w/ null-terminators
        - other is immutable span of chars but tailored to strings
- logger
    - rename error.c to log.c? or add log.c?
    - move `info` into `report` and generalize
        - pass a level and location to report()
        - update `info` and `error` to use `report` properly
    - no ansi stuff if `!istty`
- rename `scanner.c` to `lexer.c`?
- separate line indexing from `Buffer`
- better memory management
